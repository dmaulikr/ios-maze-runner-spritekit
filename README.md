ios maze runner with sprite kit

Here is the maze generator alone: https://github.com/littlebeef/ios-maze-generator-spritkit

To play: main menu offers choice of an avatar, and the size of maze. Enter a number(or just default) then click on an avatar name to start play. 

Goal: Reach the top-right corner. Or press bottom-left green button to go back to main menu.

Avatar:
- Giraffe has vision of nearby tiles. (Because it has long neck and see over the walls)
- Snail leaves trail on path it passed.
- Black box records its movment, press the bottom-right green button to "undo" its movement. This avatar has no movement animation.
- Sunday will make the whole map visable.
